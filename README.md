This folder is the canvas for your upcoming project.
It should contain:
 * this file (**README.md**)
 * the description of the structure of the program in **CMakeLists.txt**
 * a **src** directory containing the the source code of your program
 * a **doc** directory containing more documentation
 * a **deps** directory containing the draw_tools library

See [doc/COMPILING.md](doc/COMPILING.md) for a step by step tutorial on how to build the program.

See [src/main.c](src/main.c) for a small example that display "Hello world" using the draw_tools library.

See [doc/tutorial.md](doc/tutorial.md) for a step by step tutorial on how to use the draw_tools library.

See [deps/draw_tools/include/draw_tools.h](deps/draw_tools/include/draw_tools.h) for help on the draw_tools library functions.
